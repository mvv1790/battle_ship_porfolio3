<h2>How to play</h2>

This is an iteration of a pen-and-paper game Battleships.

In this version of the game a player is greeted with a welcome screen.

After that the player is asked to enter their name.

The game is made up of 6 x 6 grid, and is marked with letters on x axis and numbers on y.

The columns are separated by '|' a symbol.

Players guesses will apear as an O for a missed shot and as an X for a hit.

<h2>Features</h2>

Welcome screen, where a player is asked to push enter in order to move on.

A 6 by 6 battle board which holds 7 battle ships randomly placed on it. The goal is to hit at least three boats before the 7 turns run out.

The game accepts user input which includes numbers form 1 to 6 and letters from a to f. Any other input will be considered invalid.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

A known bug so far is the game not printing out the board after user name input is completed. This does not occur consistently and so far 
I am unaware of how to fix it.

<h2>Testin</h2>

I have manually tested the game and it is in a working state. 

I did run the code through some online validators none of which seemed to point to any problems. 

Though reliability of those validators is questionable.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

This project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.

To deploy:
1. Fork or clone a repository
2. Create a new Heroku app
3. Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order
4. Link the Heroku app to the repository
5. Click on Deploy
